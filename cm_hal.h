    description:

        This header file gives the function call prototypes and
        structure definitions used for the RDK-Broadband
        hardware abstraction layer for Cable Modem

    ---------------------------------------------------------------

    environment:

        This HAL layer is intended to support cable modem drivers
        through an open API.
        Changes may be needed to support different hardware enviornments.

* The structure members are defined as below:
*   ChannelId                       - The Cable Modem Termination System identification of the OFDM downstream channel within this particular MAC interface.
*                                     If the interface is down, the object returns the most current value.
*                                     If the downstream channel ID is unknown, this object returns a value of 0. It is an unsigned integer value. The possible range of acceptable values is 0 to (2^32)-1.
*   ChanIndicator                   - This data type defines the subcarrier spacing for the FFT mode in use.
*                                     For downstream OFDM channels, if the FFT mode is 4K mode, then spacing is 50 kHz; if it is 8K mode, then the spacing is 25 kHz.
*                                     For upstream OFDMA channels, if the FFT mode is 2K mode, then the spacing is 50kHz; if the mode is 4K mode, then the spacing is 25kHz. In units of kHz.
*                                     Possible Values: other(1), primary(2), backupPrimary(3), nonPrimary(4). It is an unsigned integer value. The possible range of acceptable values is 0 to (2^32)-1.
*   SubcarrierZeroFreq              - The center frequency of the subcarrier 0 of the OFDM transmission.
*                                     Note that since ubcarrier 0 is always excluded, it will actually be below the allowed downstream spectrum band.
*                                     This is the frequency of subcarrier X(0) in the definition of the DFT. It is an unsigned integer value. The possible range of acceptable values is 0 to (2^32)-1.
*   FirstActiveSubcarrierNum        - The number of the first non-excluded subcarrier. The valid range is 148 to 7895. It is an unsigned integer value. The possible range of acceptable values is 0 to (2^32)-1.
*   LastActiveSubcarrierNum         - The number of the last non-excluded subcarrier. The valid range is 148 to 7895. It is an unsigned integer value. The possible range of acceptable values is 0 to (2^32)-1.
*   NumActiveSubcarriers            - The number of active data subcarriers within the OFDM downstream channel (i.e. this exclude subcarriers for continuous pilots and the PLC).
*                                     For 4K FFT mode, the maximum number of subcarriers including continuous pilots and the PLC cannot exceed 3800, and for 8K FFT mode,
*                                     the maximum number of active subcarriers including continuous pilots and the PLC cannot be greater than 7600.
*                                     There are a minimum of 56 continuous pilots in a 192MHz channel that has no exclusions,
*                                     and the size of the PLC is 8 subcarriers for 4K FFT mode and 16 subcarriers for 8K FFT mode.
*                                     Therefore the maximum value of NumActiveSubcarriers is 3736 (or 3800 - 56 - 8) for 4K FFT mode and 7528 (or 7600 - 56 - 16) for 8K FFT mode.
*                                     It is an unsigned integer value. The possible range of acceptable values is 0 to (2^32)-1.
*   SubcarrierSpacing               - The subcarrier spacing associated with a particular FFT mode configured on the OFDM downstream channel.
*                                     If it is 4K mode, then the subcarrier spacing is 50kHz. If it is 8K mode, then the subcarrier spacing is 25kHz. It is an unsigned int value.
*                                     It is an unsigned integer value. The possible range of acceptable values is 0 to (2^32)-1.
*   CyclicPrefix                    - Cyclic prefix enables the receiver to overcome the effects of inter-symbol-interference and intercarrier-interference caused  by micro-reflections in the channel.
*                                     There are five possible alues for the length of the CP and the choice depends on the delay spread of the channel - a longer delay spread requires a longer cyclic prefix.
*                                     The cyclic prefix (in usec) are converted into samples using the sample rate of 204.8 Msamples/s and is an integer multiple of: 1/64 * 20 us. It is an unsigned int value.
*                                     The possible range of acceptable values is 0 to (2^32)-1.
*   RollOffPeriod                   - Roll off period maximizes channel capacity by sharpening the edges of the spectrum of the OFDM signal.
*                                     For windowing purposes another segment at the start of the IDFT output is appended to the end of the IDFT output - the roll-off postfix (RP).
*                                     There are five possible values for the (RP), and the choice depends on the bandwidth of the channel and the number of exclusion bands within the channel.
*                                     A larger RP provides sharper edges in the spectrum of the OFDM signal; however,  there is a time vs. frequency trade-off. Larger RP values reduce the efficiency of transmission in the time domain,
*                                     but because the spectral edges are sharper, more useful subcarriers appear in the frequency domain. There is an optimum value for the RP that maximizes capacity for a given bandwidth and/or exclusion band scenario. It is an unsigned int value.
*                                     The possible range of acceptable values is 0 to (2^32)-1.
*   PlcFreq                         - This is the PHY Link Channel (PLC) frequency. It is the center frequency of the lowest frequency subcarrier of the PLC.
*                                     The aim of the PLC is for the CMTS to convey to the CM the physical properties of the OFDM channel. It is an unsigned int value.
*                                     The possible range of acceptable values is 0 to (2^32)-1.
